Readme File for the lensing PDF's presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10017
Visit http://magneticum.org/simulations.html for more details on the different simulations.

The (not normalized) PDF's for kappa, log10(|mu|), and log10(gamma) for both DM-only ("dm") 
and Hydro simulations ("bao") are stored under the following folder tree:

 - Box3 (hr): 
   |-> Convergence (kappa files)
   |-> Magnification (log_mu files)
   |-> Shear (log_gamma files)
 - Box4 (uhr):
   |-> Convergence (kappa files)
   |-> Magnification (log_mu files)
   |-> Shear (log_gamma files)

The angular resolution is depicted in the file name and spans from 00.22-14.08 arcsec.
